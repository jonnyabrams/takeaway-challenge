## Description
-------

Our weekend challenge for week 2 of the Makers Academy coding boot camp in London was to build a basic food delivery program using the Twilio API to send delivery confirmation texts.

## Instructions for use
-------

1. This program can be run from the Terminal/Command Line using IRB
2. It requires Ruby 3.0.2, which can be installed with the following command:

```
rvm install 'ruby-3.0.2'
```

3. It also uses the Twilio API for sending SMS messages

```
gem install twilio-ruby
```

## User Stories
-------

The following user stories were supplied:

```
As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
```

```
As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
```

```
As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order
```

```
As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

## My Approach
-------

To start with, I created a menu_spec and test drove the functionality for browsing a menu as per the first user story:

```
jonnyabrams@JONNYs-MacBook-Pro takeaway-challenge % irb -r './lib/menu'
3.0.2 :001 > menu = Menu.new
 => 
#<Menu:0x0000000142857058
... 
3.0.2 :002 > menu.browse
bolognese: 7.5
carbonara: 6.5
puttanesca: 5.5
arrabiata: 4.5
 => {"bolognese"=>7.5, "carbonara"=>6.5, "puttanesca"=>5.5, "arrabiata"=>4.5} 
```

Then I test-drove an Order class as my primary interface, initializing it at first with an empty array as a basket to add orders to. I later changed this to a hash to facilitate my remove_dish method, which was growing cumbersome with the array.

Following the second user story, I gave my select_dish method two parameters: one for the dish itself, one for the quantity:

```
jonnyabrams@JONNYs-MacBook-Pro takeaway-challenge % irb -r './lib/order'
3.0.2 :001 > order = Order.new
 => 
#<Order:0x00000001563709b8
... 
3.0.2 :002 > order.select_dish('bolognese', 2)
 => 2 
3.0.2 :003 > order.select_dish('puttanesca')
 => 1 
3.0.2 :004 > order.basket
 => [["bolognese", 7.5], ["bolognese", 7.5], ["puttanesca", 5.5]] 
```

The third user story was as simple as creating the private method calculate_total:

```
jonnyabrams@JONNYs-MacBook-Pro takeaway-challenge % irb -r './lib/order'
3.0.2 :001 > order = Order.new
 => 
#<Order:0x000000013a0f01f0
... 
jonnyabrams@JONNYs-MacBook-Pro takeaway-challenge % irb -r './lib/order'
3.0.2 :001 > order = Order.new
 => 
#<Order:0x000000013f84fe78
... 
3.0.2 :002 > order.select_dish('carbonara')
 => 1 
3.0.2 :003 > order.select_dish('arrabiata', 3)
 => 3 
3.0.2 :004 > order.remove_dish('carbonara')
 => 1 
3.0.2 :005 > order.remove_dish('arrabiata', 2)
 => 2 
3.0.2 :006 > order.select_dish('bolognese')
 => 1 
3.0.2 :007 > order.basket
 => {"carbonara"=>0.0, "arrabiata"=>4.5, "bolognese"=>7.5} 
3.0.2 :008 > order.calculate_total
 => 12.0 
```

I also added a 'fail' guard clause in case of unavailable dishes:

```
jonnyabrams@JONNYs-MacBook-Pro takeaway-challenge % irb -r './lib/order'
3.0.2 :001 > order = Order.new
 => 
#<Order:0x0000000149a940d0
... 
3.0.2 :002 > order.select_dish('gnocchi')
/Users/jonnyabrams/Projects/Makers/takeaway/takeaway-challenge/lib/order.rb:14:in `select_dish': This is not on the menu (RuntimeError)
        from (irb):2:in `<main>'
        from /Users/jonnyabrams/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.0.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/irb-1.3.5/exe/irb:11:in `<top (required)>'
        from /Users/jonnyabrams/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.0.2/bin/irb:23:in `load'
        from /Users/jonnyabrams/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.0.2/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
```

Then it was time to implement a checkout method sending a confirmation text via the Twilio API:

```
jonnyabrams@JONNYs-MacBook-Pro takeaway-challenge % irb -r './lib/order'
3.0.2 :001 > order = Order.new
 => 
#<Order:0x00000001450f58c0
... 
3.0.2 :002 > order.select_dish('carbonara', 3)
 => 3 
3.0.2 :003 > order.select_dish('bolognese')
 => 1 
3.0.2 :004 > order.select_dish('puttanesca', 2)
 => 2 
3.0.2 :005 > order.checkout
carbonara: 19.5
bolognese: 7.5
puttanesca: 11.0
*************

## Improvements Needed
-------

With a basket in the form of a hash, the bill cannot separate multiple orders of the same dish (although it does charge the correct amount).

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fork this repo
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * The text should state that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.

> :warning: **WARNING:** think twice before you push your **mobile number** or **Twilio API Key** to a public space like GitHub :eyes:
>
> :key: Now is a great time to think about security and how you can keep your private information secret. You might want to explore environment variables.

* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this at this moment.
